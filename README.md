# Source Files of the MBE Growth Simulation Code (Windows)
This is the source file package of the MBE Growth Simulation Code for Windows users. For Mac users, please find the source files and compiled code using this [link](https://github.com/tianshi-wang/MBE_Growth_Simulation_Code-Mac).

The compiled code is released [here](https://github.com/tianshi-wang/MBE_Growth_Simulation_Code-Windows/releases). The code can simulate growth morphology at different conditions for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The calculation is based on kinetic Monte Carlo method. The interactive 3D rending is excellent for education purpose.

The coded is based on the KMCInterative code written by Michael Grundmann (mgrundmann@ece.ucsb.edu). The paper about KMCInteractive can be found at this [website](http://my.ece.ucsb.edu/mgrundmann/kmcinteractive/mbesimpaper.pdf).

The code is written using C++ with OpenGL and QT5. To revise or recompile the code, first download [QT5](https://www1.qt.io/download-open-source/?hsCtaTracking=f977210e-de67-475f-a32b-65cec207fd03%7Cd62710cd-e1db-46aa-8d4d-2f1c1ffdacea#section-2). Then, open the downloaded source files with QT5. Before built the project, add your glu and glut library in "MBEcodeProject.pro".
